<p>This document describes the implementation of an
<b>Occam</b> to <b>EM</b> compiler. The lexical analysis is
done using <b>Lex</b>. For the semantic analysis the
extended LL(1) parser generator <b>LLgen</b> is used. To
handle the Occam-specific features as channels and
parallelism some library routines are required.</p>
<a name="1. Introduction"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Occam [1] is a programming language which is based on
the concepts of concurrency and communication. These
concepts enable today&rsquo;s applications of
microprocessors and computers to be implemented more
effectively.</p>

<p>An Occam program consists of a (dynamically determined)
number of processes communicating through channels. To
communicate with the outside world some predefined channels
are needed. A channel has only one writer and one reader; it
carries machine words and bytes, at the
reader/writer&rsquo;s discretion. The process with its
communication in Occam replaces the procedure with
parameters in other languages (there are no procedures in
Occam).</p>

<p>In addition to the normal assignment statement, Occam
has two more information-transfer statements, the input and
the output:</p>
<pre>          chan1 ? x        -- reads a value from chan1 into x
          chan2 ! x        -- writes the value of x onto chan2
</pre>

<p>Both the outputting and the inputting processes wait
until the other is there. Channels are declared and given
names.</p>

<p><b>2</b></p>

<p>Arrays of channels are possible.</p>

<p>Processes come in 5 varieties: sequential, parallel,
alternative, conditional and repetitive. A process starts
with a reserved word telling its nature, followed by an
indented list of other processes. (Indentation is used to
indicate block structure.) It may be preceded by
declarations. The processes in a sequential/parallel process
are executed sequentially/in parallel. The processes in an
alternative process have guards based on the availability of
input; the first to be ready is executed (this is waiting
for multiple input). The conditional and repetitive
processes are normal <b>IF</b>s and <b>WHILE</b>s.</p>

<p><i>Producer-consumer example:</i></p>
<pre>     CHAN buffer:                    -- declares the channel buffer
     PAR
       WHILE TRUE                    -- the producer
         VAR x:                      -- a local variable
         SEQ
           produce(x)                -- in some way
           buffer ! x                -- and send it
       WHILE TRUE                    -- the consumer
         VAR x:
         SEQ
           buffer ? x                -- get a value
           consume(x)                -- in some way
</pre>

<p><b>3</b></p>

<p>Processes can be replicated from a given template; this
combines with arrays of variables and/or channels.</p>

<p><i>Example: 20 window-sorters in series:</i></p>
<pre>     CHAN s[20]:                     -- 20 channels
     PAR i = [ 0 FOR 19 ]            -- 19 processes
       WHILE TRUE
         VAR v1, v2:
         SEQ
           s[i] ? v1; v2             -- wait for 2 variables from s[i]
           IF
             v1 &lt;= v2                -- ok
               s[i+1] ! v1; v2
             v1 &gt; v2                 -- reorder
               s[i+1] ! v2; v1
</pre>

<p>A process may wait for a condition, which must include a
comparison with <b>NOW</b>, the present clock value.</p>

<p>Processes may be distributed over several processors;
all processes under a <b>VAR</b> declaration must run on the
same processor. Concurrency can be improved by avoiding
<b>VAR</b> declarations, and replacing them by <b>CHAN</b>
declarations. Processes can be allocated explicitly on named
processors and channels can be connected to physical
ports.</p>
<a name="2. The Compiler"></a>
<h2>2. The Compiler</h2>

<p>The compiler is written in <b>C</b> using LLgen and Lex
and compiles Occam programs to EM code, using the procedural
interface as defined for EM. In the following sub-sections
we describe the LLgen parser generator and the aspect of
indentation.</p>
<a name="2.1. The LLgen Parser Generator"></a>
<h2>2.1. The LLgen Parser Generator</h2>

<p>LLgen accepts a Context Free syntax extended with the
operators &lsquo;<tt>*</tt>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<tt>?</tt>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<tt>+</tt>&rsquo; that have effects similar to
those in regular expressions. The &lsquo;<tt>*</tt>&rsquo;
is the closure set operator without an upperbound;
&lsquo;<tt>+</tt>&rsquo; is the positive closure operator
without an upperbound; &lsquo;<tt>?</tt>&rsquo; is the
optional operator; &lsquo;<tt>[</tt>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<tt>]</tt>&rsquo; can be used for grouping. For
example, a comma-separated list of expressions can be</p>

<p><b>4</b></p>

<p>described as:</p>
<pre>          expression_list:
                 expression [ &rsquo;,&rsquo; expression ]*
               ;
</pre>

<p>Alternatives must be separated by
&lsquo;<tt>|</tt>&rsquo;. C code
(&lsquo;&lsquo;actions&rsquo;&rsquo;) can be inserted at all
points between the colon and the semicolon. Variables global
to the complete rule can be declared just in front of the
colon enclosed in the brackets &lsquo;<tt>{</tt>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<tt>}</tt>&rsquo;. All other declarations are local
to their actions. Nonterminals can have parameters to pass
information. A more mature version of the above example
would be:</p>
<pre>            expression_list(expr *e;)       {     expr e1, e2;   } :
                     expression(&amp;e1)
                     [ &rsquo;,&rsquo; expression(&amp;e2)
                                            {     e1=append(e1, e2);  }
                     ]*
                                            {     *e=e1;    }
                   ;
</pre>

<p>As LLgen generates a recursive-descent parser with no
backtrack, it must at all times be able to determine what to
do, based on the current input symbol. Unfortunately, this
cannot be done for all grammars. Two kinds of conflicts are
possible, viz. the <b>alternation</b> and <b>repetition</b>
conflict. An alternation confict arises if two sides of an
alternation can start with the same symbol. E.g.</p>

<p><b>5</b></p>
<pre>          plus:     &rsquo;+&rsquo; | &rsquo;+&rsquo; ;
</pre>

<p>The parser doesn&rsquo;t know which
&lsquo;<tt>+</tt>&rsquo; to choose (neither do we). Such a
conflict can be resolved by putting an <b>if-condition</b>
in front of the first conflicting production. It consists of
a <b>&lsquo;&lsquo;%if&rsquo;&rsquo;</b> followed by a
C-expression between parentheses. If a conflict occurs (and
only if it does) the C-expression is evaluated and parsing
continues along this path if non-zero. Example:</p>
<pre>          plus:
                 %if (some_plusses_are_more_equal_than_others())
                 &rsquo;+&rsquo;
               |
                 &rsquo;+&rsquo;
               ;
</pre>

<p>A repetition conflict arises when the parser cannot
decide whether
&lsquo;&lsquo;<tt>productionrule</tt>&rsquo;&rsquo; in e.g.
&lsquo;&lsquo;<tt>[ productionrule ]*</tt>&rsquo;&rsquo;
must be chosen once more, or that it should continue. This
kind of conflicts can be resolved by putting a
<b>while-condition</b> right after the opening parentheses.
It consists of a <b>&lsquo;&lsquo;%while&rsquo;&rsquo;</b>
followed by a C-expression between parentheses. As an
example, we can look at the <b>comma-expression</b> in C.
The comma may only be used for the comma-expression if the
total expression is not part of another comma-separated
list:</p>
<pre>          comma_expression:
                 sub_expression
                 [ %while (not_part_of_comma_separated_list())
                      &rsquo;,&rsquo; sub_expression
                 ]*
</pre>

<p><b>6</b></p>
<!-- TABS -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="4" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="10%">
</td>
<td width="10%">

<p><tt>;</tt></p>
</td>
<td width="69%">
</td>
</table>

<p>Again, the <b>&lsquo;&lsquo;%while&rsquo;&rsquo;</b> is
only used in case of a conflict.</p>

<p>Error recovery is done almost completely automatically.
All the LLgen-user has to do is write a routine called
<i>LLmessage</i> to give the necessary error messages and
supply information about terminals found missing.</p>
<a name="2.2. Indentation"></a>
<h2>2.2. Indentation</h2>

<p>The way conflicts can be resolved are of great use to
Occam. The use of indentation, to group statements, leads to
many conflicts because the spaces used for indentation are
just token separators to the lexical analyzer, i.e.
&lsquo;&lsquo;white space&rsquo;&rsquo;. The lexical
analyzer can be instructed to generate &lsquo;BEGIN&rsquo;
and &lsquo;END&rsquo; tokens at each indentation change, but
that leads to great difficulties as expressions may occupy
several lines, thus leading to indentation changes at the
strangest moments. So we decided to resolve the conflicts by
looking at the indentation ourselves. The lexical analyzer
puts the current indentation level in the global variable
<i>ind</i> for use by the parser. The best example is the
<b>SEQ</b> construct, which exists in two flavors, one with
a replicator and one process:</p>
<pre>          seq i = [ 1 for str[byte 0] ]
               out ! str[byte i]
</pre>

<p>and one without a replicator and several processes:</p>
<pre>          seq
               in ? c
               out ! c
</pre>

<p><b>7</b></p>

<p>The LLgen skeleton grammar to handle these two is:</p>
<pre>          SEQ            {    line=yylineno; oind=ind; }
          [      %if (line==yylineno)
                 replicator
                 process
               |
                 [ %while (ind&gt;oind) process ]*
          ]
</pre>

<p>This shows clearly that, a replicator must be on the
same line as the <b>SEQ</b>, and new processes are collected
as long as the indentation level of each process is greater
than the indentation level of <b>SEQ</b> (with appropriate
checks on this identation).</p>

<p>Different indentation styles are accepted, as long as
the same amount of spaces is used for each indentation
shift. The ascii tab character sets the indentation level to
an eight space boundary. The first indentation level found
in a file is used to compare all other indentation levels
to.</p>

<p>It is now time to describe the implementation of some of
the occam-specific features such as channels and <b>NOW</b>.
Also the way communication with UNIX&dagger; is performed
must be described.</p>
